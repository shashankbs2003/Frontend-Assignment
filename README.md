### Frontend Assignment

This repository contains the solution for a frontend assignment, showcasing a responsive webpage with two main sections: a hero section and a gallery section.

#### **Features**

* **Responsive Design:** The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile views using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
* **Hero Section:** A full-width hero image with a content overlay, including a heading, a paragraph of text, and a call-to-action button.
* **Gallery Section:** A dynamic image grid that adapts to different screen sizes, accompanied by a text box.
* **CSS-only Mobile Navigation:** The navigation menu is styled to be a simple vertical list on mobile devices without the need for JavaScript to function.

#### **File Structure**

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
-   `index.css`: The stylesheet that provides all the visual styling and handles the responsive layout.
-   `menu-bar.png`: The image file used for the mobile menu icon.
-   `pexels-robin-stickel-70497.jpg`: The hero image.
-   `pexels-rachel-claire-6752433.jpg`: An image for the gallery section.
-   `pexels-mister-mister-3434523.jpg`: An image for the gallery section.
-   `pexels-eva-bronzini-6141651.jpg`: An image for the gallery section.
-   `icons8-arrow-30.png`: The image file for the arrow icon in the gallery section.

#### **How to View**

To view this project, simply open the `index.html` file in any web browser. You can also deploy it to a web server to see it live. The website is fully responsive, so you can test the different layouts by resizing your browser window or viewing it on a mobile device.
